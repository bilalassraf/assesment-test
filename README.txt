I've Choosed.

Code to write tests
=====================
3) App/Helpers/TeHelper.php method willExpireAt
4) App/Repository/UserRepository.php, method createOrUpdate

1: I felt there were some unnecessary varibales were decelared
2: There were unnecessary if conditions.
3: There were different styles or array variable decleration i,e $variable = []; and $variable = array();, I think we should use one style of code format for whole project.
4: I chagned the model vriable to user beacuse I think we should use revelant or simillar variable names to tables.
5: I've changed the $request['field_name'] to $request->field_name both can be used but I like to user object notation.
6: In "willExpireAt" there are some logical mistakes I've solved that.
